                    <Title>Who We Are</Title>

                    <Text>Nestri is an open-source cloud gaming platform that lets you play games on your own terms — invite friends to join your gaming sessions, share your game library, and take even more control by hosting your own gaming server. Our hosted version is perfect for those who need GPU support, providing seamless gaming experiences for everyone.</Text>

                    <Title>Privacy and Security</Title>

                    <Text>We take your privacy and security very seriously. We adhere to stringent data protection laws and ensure that all data, including games downloaded from Steam on behalf of the user, is encrypted. We also collect and log IP addresses to avoid abuse and ensure the security of our services. For more details, please review our

                            Privacy Policy</Link>.
                    </Text>

                    <Title>Acceptance of Terms</Title>

                    <Text>By using Nestri, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you're using Nestri on behalf of an organization, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that organization.</Text>

                    <Title>Your Games</Title>

                    <Text>You can run the games you own on Nestri. Please check the list of video games available on Nestri before purchasing a subscription. Sorry, but we will not provide a refund if a game you want to play is not available.

                    </Text>

                    <Title>Game Ownership and Piracy</Title>

                    <Text>Nestri strictly prohibits the use of our platform for piracy. We are not liable if you are caught pirating using any of our products. Only run games that you legally own.</Text>

                    <Title>Family Sharing</Title>

                    <Text>Nestri allows family sharing by enabling your friends to access your Steam account from their Nestri account. Please take care of who you share your Nestri membership with. Note that no two people can play a game simultaneously as per Steam's requirements.</Text>

                    <Title>Cloud Saves</Title>

                    <Text>We use a custom cloud save provider to ensure your game progress is preserved for all the games you play. If you exit a game properly or close the stream for more than 15 minutes, we will automatically save your progress. However, this is limiting, and you may need to contact us to retrieve your game progress, if you plan on migrating to another service.</Text>

                    <Title>Your Responsibilities</Title>

                    <Text>Your use of our services must comply with these Terms and applicable Nestri policies, as well as applicable laws.
