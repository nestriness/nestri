    <description summary="extends wl_seat with gaming input devices">
      A global interface to provide gaming input devices for a given seat.

      Currently only gamepad devices are supported.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding uinterface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and uinterface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.

    <request name="vibrate" since="2">
      <description summary="triggers the vibration event">
        Triggers the vibration event on the gamepad vibrator. The gamepad is only allowed to
        vibrate while the window is in focus. The values in the timings array are 64-bit integers
        and the values in the amplitudes array are unsigned 8-bit integers.
        The timings array and the amplitudes array are of the same length.
        For each timing/amplitude pair, the amplitude determines the strength of
        the vibration and the timing determines the length of the vibration in milliseconds.
        Amplitude values must be between 0 and 255. An amplitude of 0 implies no vibration
        and any timing/amplitude pair with a timing value of 0 is ignored.
        The repeat argument determines the index at which the vibration pattern to repeat begins.
        A repeat value of -1 disables repetition. If repetition is enabled, the vibration
        pattern will repeat indefinitely until stopped, or when focus is lost.
